# html-chess

This is a simple single-page of chess game I created in an evening for fun. It is written in vanilla js, html and CSS. It was done to explore building outside of frameworks. While tools like react, angular, etc. can do so much for us, but sometimes I feel many could be served best by well-implemented basics. It is playable, but you must know the rules and enforce them yourself.
