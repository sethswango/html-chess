# html-chess

This is a simple chess game written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I created one evening for fun. It was done to explore building outside of frameworks. While tools like react, angular, etc. can do so much for us, but sometimes I feel many could be served best by well-implemented basics. It is playable, but you must know the rules and enforce them yourself.
